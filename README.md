## 🔍 Why Release This?

This version represents a **class-level institutional platform** — a product of real-world experience, not theory. Creating such a platform requires deep domain knowledge, time, and hard-earned lessons from real trading.

We have now moved on to direct integration with MetaTrader and cTrader in our commercial systems, but this version is made public to share value with the community.

> We hope this helps you learn, get inspired, and maybe even contribute toward future versions.
